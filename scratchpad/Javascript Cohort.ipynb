    "\n",
    "The *Intro to Javascript Online Cohort* is a DIY approach workshop that combines the flexibility of independent study (by utilizing a well-established online programming course provided by [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming)) with in-person instructional coaching.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the week, participants will progress through Khan Academy's *Intro to JS: Drawing & Animation* on-line programming course, learning at their own pace through watching videos and completing assignments. Participants will then congregate during the Tech Tuesdays Focus Group where they will discuss and share what they've learned with others in the cohort. An instructional coach will be available in-person to address questions and provide feedback.\n",

    "## Logistics\n",
    "\n",
    "A Fresno Ideaworks instructional coach will setup a private online class at Khan Academy in which participants join. During the week, participants will utilize their personal computers to watch videos and complete assignments at their own pace. Participants are then encourages to meet with instructional coaches; Fresno Ideaworks will provide a forum during Tech Tuesdays in which participants can ask questions in person, demonstrate their projects, and share what they've learned with others in the cohort. By the end of the first Khan Academy course, they will have knowledge of early Computer Science fundamentals as well as have completed a handful of basic projects."

    "###  Why an Online Cohort?\n",
    "\n",
    "There has been an influx in requests for programming workshops at Fresno Ideaworks. However, the shop currently doesn't have the capacity or equipment. The lack of a computer lab is the obvious reason, and there may not be a computer lab for the forseeable future. In addition to logistical concerns, the primary focus of Fresno Ideaworks is hardware, and purely focused programming classes are better suited for Bitwise."
